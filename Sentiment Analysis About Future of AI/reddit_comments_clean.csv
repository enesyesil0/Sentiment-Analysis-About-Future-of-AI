"Most if not all white-collar jobs. Depending on how robotics go, blue collar jobs may go fairly swiftly as well.  
Once a significant percentage of jobs are automated - ie no longer available to humans, then many humans will not have an income nor any prospect of gaining an income, well... there are plenty of real world examples of what happens.

I don't know how we might prepare. The incentives to reduce human participation in employment are deeply entrenched and highly lucrative for the few people at the top.

imho we'll probably be faced with global privation and starvation on scales that nobody dares imagine. The rich will do quite well though.",eddnedd,2024-12-10 22:38:20,Will AI eventually replace human jobs?,3

"One approach to predicting the future: look at the past for clues.  By looking at innovations that caused radical transformation (e.g. electricity, railroads, cars, computers, Internet), we can learn a bit about what might happen with AI.  I'm not saying these are all equivalent innovations, but many of the predictions about the future after these historical innovations were simply wrong. It's hard to imagine now, but people feared electricity.  They worried that people would not survive traveling over 30 mph in a train.  The Internet was predicted to bring an end to many jobs.  As we now know, these innovations did have some negative consequences, but I think we would agree they also brought massive benefits to society.  I suspect the same will be true with AI.  Will AI disrupt jobs? Absolutely.  Will it create new job opportunities?  Yes.  The people who thrived past radical innovations were those who paid close attention, learned about it, and found ways to adapt.",Chiefs24x7,2024-12-10 22:43:04,Will AI eventually replace human jobs?,2

"It already has.

Edit on PC:

Anything leaning on language is at risk; we are going to see some major problems in marketing teams. It has been pretty extensively tested on coding applications and those companies are the most likely to embrace it. If finance starts to realize it is good with formulas they are likely to consolidate.

You should already have skills with AI and you need good soft skills; this isn't necessarily being good with people, this is being good at showing up, being available, and showing willingness to be nimble. Otherwise, get into a trade; robotics aren't likely to take off in a way that will replace trades people in our lifetimes so stuff like electrical, HVAC, plumbing, etc are all good places to be, doubly so since they already pay pretty well.

We are in an incredibly slow economy right now; most jobs are ghost jobs unless you are looking in specifics places. We are almost certainly about to enter one of the worst economies in our lifetimes and potentially since the US's creation; having physical skills or being tenured in an industry that is essential might help.

Finally, AI will never make decisions, so doing anything where you are the responsible party - security comes to mind - will be safe, but is likely to be consolidated.",ZaetaThe_,2024-12-10 22:44:59,Will AI eventually replace human jobs?,1

"The nail gun example is great. We're talking about efficiency increase so you need fewer programmers, we're not really saying AI literally does the job alone and replaces programmers.

We've been doing this for decades though, massive increases in productivity came from moving from 1GL, to 2GL, to 3GL languages. Within 3GL languages there are big differences too, i.e. you can write C# far more productively than C, and it's not about experience in the language, it's about what the language can do.

Modern IDEs increase productivity massively, how much faster I am in Visual Studio vs. something like Notepad is crazy. 

Easy availability of libraries makes a colossal difference, I'm not rolling my own database driver or HTTP server, I'm downloading it.

Since the beginning of programming, programmers have become enormously more efficient, I'm taking 100x or more if you compare writing machine code on an Altair vs. C# in a modern IDE. 100x is really the baseline, could easily be 1000x.

Yet we need more programmers than ever.

Software is more and more complex, so it doesn't matter if programmers are 100x more efficient, it's 10,000x more work. Compare Windows 3.1 to Windows 11, how many more programmers are needed? 500x? Or a game? Pong vs. Breath of the Wild? 1000x?

The number of man hours to make software has increased \*more\* than the massive gains in efficiency.

I've gone on too long. 

TLDR; AI will increase efficiency, but we've been doing that forever, and still need more developers than ever.",ToThePillory,2024-09-19 09:57:51,Has anyone actually heard of AI replacing their job as a programmer?,1

"The current state of AI isn't ready yet. But research is moving fast and with each new model release by the big players takes us a bigger step forward. 

This progress doesn't appear to be linear either. Each model is a significantly larger step forward. My take is to measure where it is now and the reassess with each new cutting edge model release to see how it's progress. My hope is that it provides enough information to predict when things will land in the future. 

Current research with my off-hours dev crew is that we are likely a 1 to 2 years out before we see significant impact. Likely closer to the 1 year mark.

So, as devs become more efficient, it may lead to more orgs hiring more devs or new completely orgs forming to take advantage of the efficiencies.

All the time is spent fixing bugs, and each bug fix causes two more bugs. Eventually all new development grinds to a halt, and no one knows how to fix the disaster they've found themselves in.

">But they don’t care about the meager earnings or the fact that they don’t know how to do shit. 

Might be meager to you. But there's a reason people do it. It's not about getting in on the western success. It's about earning a living for their family. They don't know shit because the corporations are paying the minimum amound of money possible, and getting the worst of the software engineering lot. You get what you pay for. There are better engineers in India. They prefer to work for companies that provide decent salaries. And they usually don't do outsourcing work. They work on Indian startups or work for foreign companies that want to sell their products in the Indian market. 

>They have no care at all for how they’re negatively impacting industries, wages , because they're doing better than whatever else they could do otherwise (farming, call center scamming, etc).

It's not their ' fault ' that jobs are coming to their country. What are they supposed to do? Not take them out of a sense of principle and empathy for the poor starving western families? Boycott them because, oh, will anyone think about the westerners and their software industry. Truly a war crime they are committing. It is mind boggling how self centred your take is. 

Your western companies are outsourcing to poor countries on their own accord. The Indians are not forcing them to come here. Why would Indians not take a job when a foreign company comes to their country offering them one? 

It's a consequence of capitalism, plain and simple. If India ever becomes developed, lots of those jobs will leave India too for the next cheap market. You guys lost much of your manufacturing to China because of capitalism, and now, outsourcing will continue to happen due to capitalism. It's just how capitalism functions. It doesn't care about 'negative impact' on wages, industries, only about making as much profit as possible.

"First, 400, not 800, muskets were invented in the 16th century.

>Also you are still wrong. An AK47 has a cycle rate of 600-800 rounds per minute, but requires magazine changes, and has a much lower sustained fire rate even if it didn't. Even the M249 belt fed machine gun has an max sustained fire rate of 100 rounds per minute, beyond that it will overheat and fail. 100 / 12 = 8.3 archers. Obviously the firearm can be fired from a prone position and the archer must stand, but the archer can also use indirect fire to hit targets behind obstacles. Rifle cartridges have a much longer range of course. Archers would of course get tired after sustained fire.

You realize you're nitpicking hard, right? 

Take the M134 Minigun, which fires up to 6000 rounds per minute, and compare archers with it. The point still stands. Who cares? Modern arms are not in the same universe as bows. What are we arguing about here?

Second, the iteration rate of technology is orders of magnitude faster than the 400 years that it took for muskets to evolve into modern-day weapons. We went from computers that were hardly more capable than calculators and were the size of a building half a century ago to iPhones. The rate of improvement is astounding. AI is again, a technology in its infancy. If it continues growing there's a huge risk of it outperforming humans in every task in the near future.",KrakenBitesYourAss,2024-09-18 19:58:09,Has anyone actually heard of AI replacing their job as a programmer?,-7

"There are 2 major things most people (and businesses) aren't really taking into account when worrying about AI:  

1. ""Autonomous driving"" systems have been ""just around the corner"" for decades. They still aren't less prone to cause accidents than human drivers.  

We over simplify what us humans actually do to a ridiculous degree, and are easily fooled by technology paired with enough buzzwords and propaganda. These systems aren't as impressive as they seem.  

2. These systems are a lot more expensive to run, train, and use than people realize. Running and using these systems are currently heavily subsidized by venture capital.  

Most jobs this tech can actually do well aren't really cheaper than hiring a human to do the same. Users just aren't being charged the real cost. Grocers thought they'd save oodles in staffing costs via self-checkouts. It turns out they didn't replace as many staff and the machines are more expensive to keep in repair than they expected. Some grocers are now ripping out the self-checkouts and hiring back staff they laid off.  

My job specifically, ChatGPT can't currently summarize accurately. It definitely can't do my job in 5 years' time. It probably will make a few tasks I do easier. I also suspect in 5-10y ears companies will be replacing some AI systems with humans because they're either more reliable or cheaper.",missplaced24,2024-02-18 23:11:46,Do you think AI can replace your job in the next 5 years? ,4

I could realistically boil most of my days down to some tasks / problems which are A) deciphering poorly formulated requests from clients who are terrible at writing emails and B) checking every single aspect of a complex deliverable our team produced before it gets put live or sent to a client. 

Maybe if more people asked ChatGPT to write their emails I wouldn't have a problem with A, and if our product team would do better QA with a bot I'm all on board for that.

If I could shave off 5-8 hours a week thanks to some AI, it would mean I wouldn't be working so much overtime.

"Massage therapist here, after an especially taxing week of curmudgeonly clients and collapsing carpal tunnels. AI overlords replacing RMTs? Not out of the realm of possibility!  No way could we ever be replaced in providing authentic, intuitive human touch, not to mention, oh you know, genuine *care*. However! Tools such as massage guns have gained impressive efficacy and popularity as of late, for example. And admittedly, some clients simply want just a fluffy run thru, hit some trigger points like a shiatsu chair, a humanesque droid potentially providing such. Integrate client complaint, contraindications, medical history, range of motion, technique and style preference, gauging of muscle tension, adhesions, atrophy, tissue response all the while performing acceptable massage techniques.... attainable!  Anything is possible, though I'll continue enjoying the care and connection massage can offer.

"Not worried. I'm an optical engineer. I am protected by a few things:

1-A lot of the work is practical and experimental: Ultimately, while some of my work might be replaceable, most requires a body, and one that knows what its doing. Neither robots nor AI are anywhere near that level.

2-The theoretical work requires understanding: So one issue is that my bosses dont really know what I do. If they wanted to get an AI to do, lets say, my design work, they wouldnt have the means to know if it did a good job or not (at least, until they actually build a prototype). I've got programmer aquaintances who are able to use AI to speed up coding, but they still gotta verify (and at least in their case, its relatively easy to check-for a complex system containing optical, electrical, and mechanical elements, its hard to ID problems without extensive practical experience).

3-Lack of documentation/formalisation: So others have mentionned that a lot of expertise simply isnt documented in a way usable to AI. I would also say that outside of some very large, well-organised companies, most places arent super-documented. A place I worked for before had virtually nothing beyond some basic (and far from exhaustive) reports-it relied mostly on people's memory. And where I work for now, where they document decently, we still have to rely on some memory as no report can be absolutely un-ambiguous without having a ton of people going over it (which really only happens in large, high-efficiency corps).

This is also a problem in science/high-tech in general: most companies guard their knowledge very carefully, so many techniques and much practical engineering isnt widely available (which causes a bunch of problems tied to reproducibility, but thats another issue).

\+++

To summarize, a lot (if not most) of my work remains in meatspace, AI isnt yet foolproof enough to generate valid work without verification, and much of the info needed for it to be better is either in people's brains or in vault-like servers.

\+++

From what I understand, current LLM-boosted generative AI is great for generating formulaic, easy to validate stuff-form letters, programming code (and even then, only for simple stuff), and stock photography/image generation.

Now, the machine learning behind these systems is used by a great many experts to try to recognise patterns in data, and thats been the case for a while. However, the opacity of the systems (IE, its no always clear how it arrives at ""conclusions""), the lack of clarity in objectives (IE, I've seen exploratory use to try to ID things that are good/bad on a production line, but they dont know what they're looking for), and the often poor quality of data (IE, just cause the data's there doesn't mean there's no bias or error inside the dataset) has limited their wider deployment. You generally need to think about how you collect data before you can adapt machine learning systems, and have clear objectives for it to provide pertinent info-which all requires extensive expertise in programming, data analysis, and whatever subject matter you're analyzing.",Wendigo_Bob,2024-02-19 01:37:36,Do you think AI can replace your job in the next 5 years? ,1

I’m also no software coder - ai is useless to me as I don’t really know where to start to ask it. Also the output of that code is much more “functional”. It works well or it doesn’t - there’s no real room for individual interpretation.

"Software engineer here too and disagree massively. I remember using GPT2 years ago in like 2020? I forgot when it actually released, but even back then writing was on the wall long before ChatGPT.

The rate of increase has been staggering and so far we haven’t seemed to hit any “soft caps”. Google just announced their 1 and 10 million context window models. GPT4 is pretty decent at coding.

But all of that is “old news” GPT4 may as well be ignored and forgotten in a few months here. GPT5, Gemini 1.5 Ultra and Gemini 2 should release sometime this year. But again, ignore that. Who cares. Even those will be absolute soon. The freaking “small stepping stones” (GPT4, Gemini) are already insanely capable, and they are basically alpha tests.

">I’ve heard that bookkeepers and accountants will be replaced

When I was working in audit at a larger firm pre-covid, we sent a lot of this work to India. I heard this is happening more often now. (I don't think it should be done, but it's not like they would have listened to me anyways)

There was also an internal AI tool that was developed that would read through thousands of pages and attempt to provide summaries for information you deemed important (for documentation, etc.). When I was at the firm a lot of partners refused to use this because they didn't trust it. (If you worked at this firm, it's probably obvious by now what firm it was)

Staff/intermediate accountant roles are essentially there to get people to senior/manager and up.

They often screw everything up and blow budgets. They're ""training"" jobs. You employ 5 staffs and hope 1 or 2 make it to manager, you're fine with the rest moving on elsewhere.

I don't know much about AI, but firms would 100% use AI to cut costs since (as mentioned) staff/intermediate accountants screw the majority of things up anyways.

With that being said, doing that will lead to a shortage of seniors/managers, so who knows.

Long story short, if AI doesn't replace low level accountants it isn't because it can't it would be because it would prevent any senior accountants and up from being developed, hurting these firms in the process.",Unknown,2024-02-19 06:45:48,Do you think AI can replace your job in the next 5 years? ,2

a) in order to get around legal issues, Algorithms need to be drawn from a library that's made and curated by artists. Commercial libraries aren't going to cut it.


b) those algorithms need an output that fits into the existing animation pipeline. For 2D that means a harmony file, for 3D that means a Maya file. And it probably won't be able to manipulate a pre-existing rig, but simultaneously it will have to output a semi-rigged output if, as you said, someone is going to go into the animation to fix it.


And they will have to fix it. We need scene fixers now when the output is 100% human. The result is that most animators will just become scene fixers. Yes, junior positions will fall off, but more shows are going to get made. That's what happened with programs like Flash, Harmony, or Maya.

Therapy apps will take a notable share of the counseling market. There are already automated apps that do a decent job of talking people through panic attacks, suicidal ideation, and addiction cravings. They are getting more effective and cheaper. Soon, the AI therapists will be so well-coded that they will be used by human therapists as learning tools. You will be able to choose between Freud and Jung models to conduct your therapy or create a balance of approaches you wish to use. Children may be able to talk to kid-friendly avatars that they recognize like Peppa or Bluey. It will be cheaper and more accessible than in-person counseling with an LCSW.

Service delivery systems will be facilitated by AI and that will also cut out jobs. There are already benefit offices using entirely digital screening and assessment processes without any human interaction. County Welfare offices are eager to catch up to what federal benefit offices are doing (ie SSA has digitized basically every application).

The AI-resilient social work jobs will relate to community organizing, constituent affairs, and outreach. That is because right now, AI is behind in creating new solutions to dynamic problems such as a refugee crisis, where legal issues are intertwined with psychological trauma, material needs, and unique individual problems.

I could even see AI getting to a point where it mimicked real human interaction. Some surface level work could be done, coping skills could be suggested, CBT comes to mind as particularly friendly to AI. But I don't think it'll ever take over fully, simply because the clients' perception of speaking with a real human versus an AI will inherently affect the process. Clients want to feel a connection to their therapist - transference, for better or worse.

"I don’t think so because humans are inherently social animals, if they use ai to replace us it’s going to be devastating for the human psyche. There’s already research pointing to the relationship being the most important aspect (rather than choice of method) in for instance therapy but also anywhere people try to find a way to improve their lives. 
I do see it as a threat though and nothing anyone should take lightly because there’s already attempts to find ways to implement it. I think it’s making its way into distribution of economic resources and there’s been several of those projects in sweden, I’m not sure entirely if they use ai for it but it is standardised programs that try to calculate wether someone has right to something or not and the program can’t take any real life situation into the calculations. It’s under criticism but I think more needs to be done to prevent these things from happening…

But yeah if it gets really advanced you’ll also have to think about it being made by someone who has biases so it’s likely to end up being discriminatory in one way or another and i guess you’d have to ask how ethical it is.

"For the purpose of getting people to over commit to work for the benefits of the few - yes.  Most therapy is now for the ""working well"", aka, keep folks barely standing and get them to ignore the local world around them enough to keep them from acting in local communally beneficial ways. That's already happened in SW as it went from community practice to neoliberal diagnostic treatment modalities.  Now it's just a matter of letting AI listen to therapists and clients on internet start ups long enough to just make it completely rote and with the longer term aim of subduing dissent and destroying community awareness.  

&#x200B;

There are already thousands of therapy apps that make therapy into a phone game... It is coming and I think if SW were to return more to its community action and policy roots it would at least have a chance at change and communal good... but most people come to SW to get a cheaper and less intensive way to become a one on one or family therapist now.

"Individual social workers can only use their own knowledge and experience to inform their decisions. They cannot come up with solutions outside this knowledge or factor in information they don't know. Also, individual judgment can be impacted by the context of the social workers lives. How stressed are they, when did they last eat, what are their biases and transference issues?
Sufficiently advanced AI does not have to deal with these issues. It can give a more objective assessment, if built and trained to that goal., hopefully. 
Human error leads to all sorts of bad outcomes in many high stakes activities, such as driving, hospital care, and crisis assessment.

I've done a fair amount of consultation with organizations and clinicians regarding assessing and responding to suicide risk. I cannot count the number of times when clinicians, leaders, and other staff respond something to the effect of, ""we assess for suicide risk when we need to,"" based on their judgement or gut or whatever. Often the least trained and experienced do it the least. And the most experienced follow their long standing practices rather than evidence based practices. 

It's hard to convince ""professionals"" , and especially ""experts"" to change their practice based on new information.

Same behavior, very different intervention. How can AI do that? Will it be given cameras to surveil patients? Who will keep those inputs HIPAA compliant? Do we really want to feed paranoid delusions of government surveillance? 

I wonder if the tech bros even know that some people do physical work with other humans bodies that cannot be replicated by robots - changing diapers, dressing wounds, activating mirror neurons to coregulate emotions.

"I’m curious about cross-cultural work.  I work a lot with individuals from Southeast Asia, particularly persecuted ethnic minorities.  I’ve done so for quite a few years now, and there’s really not a tremendous amount written about some of these people and their cultures.  Once in a while, I just have what feels like a hunch.  Recently, I sort of shoo-shooed another team member (😬) and demanded that they let me keep asking this client a few more questions because I could just sense that something was going on but couldn’t quite define it, and finally the gates just opened and several hours later we had really uncovered so much more information about what was holding him back and we had a much more thorough plan. This was all through an interpreter and with a culture that tends to be very hesitant to ask for help.  That was actually a really great learning moment for me and I’m still kind of tossing it around in my mind to make sure I fully understand what occurred.   

Later i accompanied this client to meet with another group of professionals and the way they interacted with them was very formulaic and there was almost no information that was actually exchanged because it just came out really odd in translation.  

So I guess it might be theoretically possible, but at this point, it’s super difficult for even trained professionals to gain the skills necessary to do the type of work described above, esp when the values of said cultures are quite different.  It’s sort of depressing, but many SWs just are not prepared to for it.

"I believe in the future AI would make this much easier. Imagine some type of virtual avatar that looked like the client and spoke the same language. It knows the social cues of the specific culture and accommodates them through the dialogue. No awkward exchanges that way or anything lost in translation. I understand the limits of not having enough source data on specific cultures to feed the algorithms but that's only a matter of time and exposure. I know this seems far-fetched, but we have to remember today is the worst this technology will ever be. It is only improving and rapidly. 

2-3 years ago no one in my sector was discussing Chat GPT, now we discuss the possibility of it replacing large portions of our jobs. What will the discussions be in 10-15 years?

As far as clients not wanting to interact with AI, I can understand that. But again I think it is just a matter of time. The next generations are being conditioned to talk and interact with family members through screens (face time, virtual doctor apts, zoom meetings for work) and this will make them feel much more comfortable interacting with digital interfaces to receive services.

Some folks prefer text therapy now over conventional in person therapy as they feel safer in the comfort of their home behind a screen. I have seen this in my short time as a mental  health counsellor. 

We are also seeing AI virtual girlfriends for folks facing isolationism. Those are folks filling a need not being met with a virtual avatar. Now I am not advocating that this is good or bad, I am just stating what is currently happening.  

So when I think about the social work landscape in 20+ years from now I believe it is naive to think we would not incorporate AI or replace some industries with AI.

"Definitely dynamic. Unfortunately, everything I have seen and heard supports the idea that (at least in terms of funding) we have generally returned to the era of the ""wealthy folks that want to feel good about themselves"" as funding sources, and evidence supports the theory that they care more about headcounts of people served than actual care.

Case in point, one agency I worked with had regular clients. They received special care and were blessed with numerous free passes on rules that applied to every other client. Why? Because they increased the headcount numbers without actual care.

Whether you say it ""Dollar dollar bills y'all"", ""money makes the world go 'round"" or ""money is power and power corrupts"", the end result here in the US is the same: The money makes the rules, and it makes rules to get more money.

Ideally, we could educate the public about what our actual impact and presence really is and they would realize numbers don't equate to care, but since we're talking pipe dreams at that point, I want a Ferrari too.

"I’m not sure I’m a whole lot more sunny than you are, but I’ve seen some bright spots on some smaller scales that have endured.  Scaling them is the problem.  Because as soon as you start adding more people/scale, you get more people that want to make their mark.  You then inevitably end up with crap like assessment processes that are 4x longer than they need to be and that terribly frustrate, piss off, or even trigger trauma in clients, simply because someone in middle management felt like they had to make everyone happy so they just said fuck it and sent an email out to each department and said “send me all the questions you want on the assessment” (face, meet palm).    I’m enduring this downward spiral right now.  

The other problem is that with non-profits, though the idea is warm & fuzzy, you’re just spending someone else’s money, so there is zero incentive to be efficient.  So when staff are frustrated by how inefficient things are and they come to mgmt with really simple solutions that would save everyone time and would save funders a lot of money so it could serve more clients (but it would require the leadership team to think hard for an hour), they can easily just say no, because what’s it to them?

"> meaningful results  

I think whether or not the results are meaningful is highly subjective and context-dependent.  

In the context of this forum and this post, the results are mixed. Everything that is generated by these tools has to be reviewed by somebody who knows what they're looking at. More often than not, the workflow involves accepting the suggested completion and then going back to fix it. It is questionable whether or not this is better than just doing the work without the assistant.  

For extremely simple and repetitive boilerplate it's more useful, but so are code templates and the existing capabilities of the IDE. 

The novelty of the almost human style output has worn off. The improvements in the past year or so have been incremental and slowing.  

This ignores the fact that software development is far more than just typing syntactically correct code. That's the easy part.

"I use GitHub Copilot, Bing Copilot, and ChatGPT nearly every day at work. In most cases I've found that it's just better than Google, with the exception being stuff that is very library or platform specific. And even in a lot of those cases they tend to perform well if you tell them to look up the documentation first.

As far as code completion, it basically gives me exactly what I want like 40-50% of the time. And of the 50-60% of the time that it doesn't give me what I want, it gets there eventually like half the time when I tell it what it did wrong.

This is a lot when you consider that 2 years ago the code completion didn't exist, and therefore gave you what you wanted 0% of the time. 

You are right that most of the job of a software developer isn't writing code at all. It's sitting in meetings with the Product Owner or with the design team or with the devops people, and figuring out big picture stuff about how are application will actually work. 

But I am *highly* skeptical that a lot of this effort won't be something that AI tech will be able to do ten years from now. A lot of the mistakes the AI makes in the current working environment can be attributed to the fact that there is a gargantuan amount of information not included in the context of the file or repo it's looking at that needs to inform it's decisions. But this is a solvable problem with realistic improvements on current technology.

Lots of the shortcomings AI has in coding can be remedied by ridiculously long context windows, easy ways to add stuff to the context in a logical way, and improvements on how it comprehensively understands its context.

That is a bigger problem than before (the juniors who have no passion for anything)  but that is a different story.

And the other reason (I name just two because I have not much time to elaborate) the AI will not succeed is the fact it is with us for years now and it is still bad and even juniors dont use it for much.

"As a software developer, I disagree with this article. 

I've been witnessing this kind of automation replacing human labor multiple times in my career. 

The company I worked for used to have an arm where they add closed captions to TV in real time. 10 years ago when the AI just started to do captioning, the industry consensus was that the AI will never be able to replace humans in this job, as some of the ambiguities are too great; you won't have enough context for what you are listening to; some people have very thick accents; accuracy is too low, etc.

I left that company 7 years ago but added a few connections in LinkedIn from that department since I thought what they were doing was cool. That team was closed last year, as OpenAI can do better than anyone in that team, provided with enough fine-tuning and pre-training and context, which real humans need those types of input anyway. 

I used the latest chatGPT the other day to write some code for me. It's already a script that's based on a chatGPT result from the last version. I asked chatGPT to add a layer of caching so the future requests would be faster. The last version of it wasn't able to handle that request. 

However, this time, it handles the request correctly, and asked me if I need to consider potential time zone inputs too. I said that's enough. 

I can totally see in another 7 years, most of the work that me and my colleagues were doing, would be replaced by AI. chips and electricity is getting cheaper and cheaper, and graphics cards don't go on holidays or get sick.",sammybeta,2024-05-19 19:40:24,AI won't replace software engineers,30

"Based on the comments, I think many people have a narrow concept of what it means to be replaced.  If it takes 9 devs to do what used to require 10, then 10% of devs could be replaced without impacting productivity, which is pretty massive.  As a dev myself, I promise you that most devs are at least 10% more productive right now.

However, there’s a competing factor and it will always work in our favor (we know this, because it always *has*), and that’s that companies don’t ask the question “are we productive enough?” They instead ask the question of what budget allocation will best increase profits.  If a certain segment of their employees are suddenly more productive, then it’s actually a *more* powerful lever and the execs are going to be even more willing to pull it.

So until AI completely replaces us (personally I believe this will happen *someday*, but that’s for another discussion) then it will likely mean greater programmer productivity which will *counterintuitively* lead to *more programmers* rather than less.",caindela,2024-05-19 23:27:35,AI won't replace software engineers,3

That means companies have a couple of options here: Hire more employees and be able to do even more or… make their employee base more lean and capable of doing the same amount of combined company production as before, but with less employees.

I’m times of low interest rates and improving consumer demand, I think my employer would lean towards hiring many more employees. But at a time of high interest rates and economic uncertainty, there is a huge push for “lean” in the tech world. With AI, that likely means many fewer devs will be hired at large tech firms compared to pre-AI times.",NebulousNitrate,2024-05-20 02:23:21,AI won't replace software engineers,1

"AI is just another tool, like IDE's or version management systems. It can (in theory) allow a developer to become more productive but it will never replace them. 

It's more of a lumberjack situation. 

Back in the olden days lumberjacks went tree to tree with axes and big-ass hand saws. It was backbreaking work and lumberjacks had to ingest truly ridiculous amounts of food to keep up the pace. 

Then the chain saw was introduced and suddenly  a single lumberjack could do the work of 50. Still dangerous and very physical work, but a massive hit to the lumberjack workforce. Lucky for them the lower price of timber also meant demand skyrocketed. 

Today forestry is done with giant machines that cut down, strip and cut to length in almost a single move, letting a single operator replace dozens of chain-saw wielders while expending less effort than ever, and sitting in a protected cage to minimize the risk of injury. 

At each stage people could say (and did) that the lumberjack was no longer needed. And to some extent they were right. The number of workers needed to cut a harvest is fewer than ever, but as of yet they haven't found a way to cut out the human operator from the equation. 

So yeah, like with every advance this will allow them to reduce headcount or extract more productivity per developer, but they still can't remove the developer from the equation. 

Also as with most engineering jobs, typing up code is far from the biggest bottleneck to overcome, and if AI can reduce the number of pointless meetings, progress reporting in five different systems so middle management can circlejerk over their kpi reports etc. then I'm all for it.",theCroc,2024-05-20 11:43:37,AI won't replace software engineers,1

There's disruption, and then there's what's happening: **fucking shit up**.

Those apartment buildings with \~50% occupancy may still be making money without people to live in them! Dozens of landlords across a region use this same AI. It's virtual price fixing!

Companyies get overwhelmed with 1000's of applicants in hours and close their offers so they can sift through what they have received.

"As an SWE how much more productive do you think AI can make you? I'm thinking more than 50% more productive conservatively in the long run. 
Some examples I see already happening in my workplace,
- AI code reviews all reviews and catches 80-90% of issues, including cross review design issues (cause same AI has read all the specs and designs) 
- AI auto completes code very well in a lot of the codebase I work in. Our codebase is very well established so there's a lot of commits for it to learn from. Saves a ton of time writing code as you can talk to it and it'll make 80%+ of your code. 
With regards to tests, in a codebase like ours, it churns out tests insanely fast and covering more cases than humans can be bothered too as well. 
-  AI investigates customer live incidents before humans check. It pulls a bunch of logs and researches bug databases, help docs etc to come up with solutions. Reduces human time on incidents a ton. 
These are only the integrations of the very first iteration of copilot. Soon I'm imagining it'll fill in more of Design, PM and likely some MGMT work.

AI reduces how much time needed to code something and reduces how much time needed to review the code and reduces a bunch of our dev time on incident investigation, our swe productivity should go way up, which grimly leads to reduction in force.

"I had to scrape through some data over the weekend that looked a lot like JSON but was actually a little off due to some string escaping and manipulation that had occurred on it. Seemed like it was going to be a pain in the ass so I thought it was a perfect opportunity to use AI to help me avoid the busy work of parsing it / writing regexes for it. 

I gave it samples of the data and told it exactly what I wanted to pull from it, and it was completely unable to present me with correct answers. At first it just tried to give me some boilerplate json parsing code, which obviously wouldn't work because the data looked a lot like json but wasn't actually valid json. Then I asked it to try regexes, and it didn't even give me correct regexes. After a handful of attempts I just gave up and wrote it all myself. Maybe this Devin AI from the article would've handled it better, but it really feels like the instant you start to deviate from perfectly standardized use cases, chat GPT completely breaks down and isn't able to help anymore.

Nope, that's not what transpires at all. Instead, people's demands and expectations of what technology will do increase, generating _more_ jobs.

"A few considerations

- ai may be able to implement some software, but as needs for complexity rises it will struggle. Companies with low software needs may be able to reduce their team in favor of ai but it's hard to believe that ai will go from being able to produce no real substantial work to designing entire application architecture, code bases all while paying attention to business rules. 

- AI in it's current state needs parented. Even when you get great results from ai, you're not giving simple instructions. If you want it to perform something within limitations you need to provide clear and concise directions and even then in it's current state there's a good chance something is wrong. Someone needs to verify their work, as well as implement it into the system and iron out integration bugs. 

- if someone was able to develop an AI that was able to produce applications so easily, why would they ever release it to the public for free, or even at a reasonable cost? That ai is worth potentially trillions of dollars, yet you expect that you would be able to just tell it to recreate GTA 5 for you? Chatgpt 3.5 is free but the most complex solutions you're getting out of there are hello world. As of now code from ai needs carefully pieced together to be even usable.

"> And what fundamentally human brain is capable of that a machine can't?

Creativity. Specifically creativity that isn't insane.

LLMs help you with brainstorming and ideas, however putting things together still takes humans to direct it and programmers are more capable now as they are directing these. 

Programmers have always generated code though, this is just a new way and a bit more contextual to create but still not exactly what you want.

AI LLMs used for code generation are a like really knowledgeable smart senior product developer that has the product and direction sense of a junior intern barely. 

Even the same question twice isn't repeatable in many cases. It isn't great for automation over existing systems because of that dynamic change. Additionally it is built on the past not present or future ideas, in fact it fights you on contrarian ideas and new styles that will be the next phase but it thinks they are incorrect. Most product innovation and ideas that change things are fought against at the beginning due to buy in and probabilities, AI just doubles down on that. AI monoculture is already a problem in AI art and code.

AI is like a really smart employee that never quite does what you ask it but pretty close. However sometimes it is straight mental and hallucinates and trips out.

the benefit though is it’s determined all the branches, laid out there mocks/stubs usually, and I can see right away if there are code paths I didn’t intend because there’s a test it tried to generate. So I go through and update the tests to be sane and call it a day instead of having to write all those test fixtures myself.

That being said, I believe I’ve heard stories of AI ECG readers being used in countries outside of the U.S as an early warning system in hospitals. Might have being Taiwan? I don’t really remember.",confused_jackaloupe,2024-05-20 00:21:45,AI won't replace software engineers,8

"Yeah for a variety of reasons (many of which are about legal attributions to the training data) we have banned any LLM generated code from entering the code-base.

A junior engineer consistently putting code up for review they don't understand would also get a talking to.",pm_me_ur_kittykats,2024-05-19 18:26:56,AI won't replace software engineers,10
"Same. It’s a great tool, but it is just a tool. It’s at its most useful when the time to write the code would take longer than to ask gpt to do the same thing. For example, I have some table structure and I want to make a class based on it. I no longer have to do that manually, I just pull the information_systems.columns or whatever and tell GPT to make my class. Which is even more helpful depending on how much context switching you do because, often times I’ll go right from TS to C# and it takes a second before my brain remembers it should be using vars in instead of const, for instance.",TB4800,2024-05-19 19:31:13,AI won't replace software engineers,2

"People should definitely try to minimize the number of meetings where they don’t participate.

If you just are joining to stay in the loop, then I would ask the organizer to forward a summary. If you only may be needed then I’d ask organizer to set up a follow up meeting with engineering questions or ping you if questions come up.

It’s easier said than done though and these decisions often aren’t in the engineers’ control.",t3hlazy1,2024-05-19 19:31:18,AI won't replace software engineers,3
Please do the needful.,MoronEngineer,2024-09-19 10:02:12,Has anyone actually heard of AI replacing their job as a programmer?,16
"No argument on musk, but AI is still in its infancy. Well... toddler phase. I wouldn't rely on a toddler to do much by themselves. Even eating, I'd supervise. But as AI learns and adapts, some models will be effective at statistical calculations, so for someone like myself with dyscalculia, it will be a great asset for compiling data. It has helped me set up a spreadsheet to track the percent of change of SEL learning. After several tweaks, the product is now being used by the entire school district. I am not a fan of statistical analysis.",Middle_Loan3715,2023-11-04 00:07:13,"Do you think that AI could eventually replace any or all social work jobs, like Elon says? If so, which ones?",3
